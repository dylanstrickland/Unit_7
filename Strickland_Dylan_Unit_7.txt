5.18

1. The script calls the shout method.
2. the shout method creates the variable: message, and assigns it the value of “Hey You”.
3. The shout method then calls the alert method to display the message variable which contains the 
“HEY YOU” string.
4. The script exits the shout method.
5. The script calls the alert method to display the variable: message. Since the message variable was created inside the shout method, it is a local variable, and not accessible to the rest of the script. The script therefore generates an ReferenceError, as it can’t find a variable named message.



5.19

1. The script calls the alert method to display the string “Hello”.
2. The script creates a variable named ‘alert’ and assigns it a value of “2”. This replaces the previous use of alert as a method call.
3. Since, within this script, alert is now a variable, the script generates a TypeError when it is used as a method call.
